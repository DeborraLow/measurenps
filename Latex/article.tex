  \abstract{In this paper, a case alternation in German measure noun phrases is examined from the perspective of cognitively oriented corpus linguistics.
    In certain pseudo-partitive constructions, the embedded kind-denoting noun either agrees in its case with the measure head noun (\textit{eine Tasse guter Kaffee} `a cup of good coffee') or it stands in the genitive (\textit{eine Tasse guten Kaffees}).
    My analysis is formulated in terms of Prototype Theory.
    I assume that the choice of alternants is influenced by non-alternating neighbouring constructions representing the prototypes more directly.
    I argue that the frequencies with which individual lemmas occur in these prototypical non-alternating constructions partially predict which alternant is chosen and that the genitive alternant is prototypical of strongly grammaticalised measure nouns.
    I present a large-scale corpus study using the DECOW corpus to support this theory.
    In the statistical analysis, I compare Maximum Likelihood estimators to Bayesian estimators (recently proposed for similar studies), showing that results \textit{predictably} do not differ.
    Finally, two experiments (forced choice and self-paced reading) are reported.
    The usage-based findings show a clear correlation with the behaviour of cognitive agents in both experiments.
    The present study therefore contributes to the well-established field of research into alternations using corpus and experimental methods.}
